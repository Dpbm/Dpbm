# About me
Hey how're doing? ðŸ‘‹\
I'm Alexandre, nice to meet youðŸ˜Š\
Once you're here, you probably wants to know more about me, and I'm glad to introduce myself.\
I'm currently an undergraduate computer science student at UNIVEM.\
My goal in this graduation it's to learn the most that I can, but my focus is in more theorical and abstract areas, like: quantum computing, machine learning and algorithms.\
As my professional career, I aim to join into the academic world, becoming a reasearcher in quantum computing and algorithms.

Recently, I've started a `scientifc initation` with focus in `quantum oracles`. In this project, I'm doing some reasearch and code tests to check some hypotesis. Sooner, my article will be published :)

## Interests

Everything about computer, programming, and technology in general.\
Now days I'm in love with quantum computing, machine learning and low level programming.
