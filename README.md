# Hey ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alexandre Silva. Nice to meet you! 

I'm a Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Computer Science Student at [UNIVEM - Centro UniversitÃ¡rio EurÃ­pides de MarÃ­lia](https://www.univem.edu.br/).\

Since I was a little kid, my passion for technology was notable. Everything was pretty exciting to me, and learning new stuff was (and still) magical to me.\
I enjoy so much new tech and creating things that may be useful for someone. 

## Main Interests

Even enjoying everything in tech, my main insterests are:
